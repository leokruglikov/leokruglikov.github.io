### Here are couple of words about me

My name is Leo Kruglikov :wave:. I am a physics major from EPFL, Switzerland.
I am currently located between Lausanne :switzerland: and Brussels :belgium:.


I am studying theoretical physics :atom:, with focus on Quantum, Solid state, Statistical physics, 
as well as computational physics in it's most general sense. 

I am also interested in computer science :computer: and programming in general. 
That is, often, low-level and high performance computing.

I love solving new problems with a mathematical and physical approach from different 
fields.
