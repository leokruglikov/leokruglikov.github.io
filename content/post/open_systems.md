For my project, I was working in the Laboratory of Theoretical Nanosystems and Open quantum systems under 
the supervision of Dr. V.Savona. 

In order to be able to construct a reliable work, one must first 
study a certain number of known results, that is described in the literature.

For that, I created a number of presentations concerning the important results.
All the presentations are available on [github repo](https://github.com/leokruglikov/open_systems).

I list, however, the topics and the presentations
1. General overview of derivations of the Lindblad master equation via different approximations. Available [here](https://github.com/leokruglikov/open_systems/blob/main/1/prez.pdf).\
Keywords: Weak coupling, Rotating wave approximation, Redfield equation.
2. Overview of decoherence, dissipation and long-time evolution. Consequences for the Lindblad. 
Available [here](https://github.com/leokruglikov/open_systems/blob/main/2/prez.pdf) and [here](https://github.com/leokruglikov/open_systems/blob/main/3/prez.pdf).\
Keywords: Decoherence, dissipation, stationarity, decoherence-free states.
