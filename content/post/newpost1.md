### Notes on basic quantum algorithms. A physics approach
I am once again sharing some of my notes, this time on basic 
quantum algorithms. This is the very beginning of, I hope, a complete 
guide to the physical and mathematical concepts in quantum computing.

Once again, the concepts are not new, rather explained versions with a more rigourous 
approach to explaining algorithms, from what is available online. The sources, as usual, 
are all listed in the document. Mainly coming from Wikipedia and Qiskit.
